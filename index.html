<!--HTML is used to define and describe your content and page structure 
Web page is a .html file that is served by a server.
The HTML content is stored in a file on a remote server and sent by the servver to the browser when a user
visits a page 
HTML Element is an annotated piece of content: HTML Tags(which include the name 
of the element) + content
We need HTML elements because they annotate content and provide more meaning to it 
HTML attributes allow user to add extra configuration to the element
